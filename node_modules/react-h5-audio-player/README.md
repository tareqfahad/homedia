## UI Overwrites

React H5 Audio Player provides built-in class names and SASS variables for developers to overwrite.

### SASS variables

- $rhap_theme-color: #868686 !default;
- $rhap_background-color: #fff !default;
- $rhap_bar-color: #e4e4e4 !default;
- $rhap_time-color: #000 !default;

## Advanced Usage

### Access to the audio element

You can get direct access to the underlying audio element. First get a ref to ReactAudioPlayer:

```jsx
<ReactAudioPlayer ref={c => (this.player = c)} />
```

Then you can access the audio element like this:

`this.player.audio`

## Migrations

### Breaking changes from 1.x to 2.x

- Removed inline styles, import `css` or `scss` manually
- Removed props `hidePlayer` - Use parent logic to hide player
- Removed props `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd` - V2 isn't using drag events anymore

### Breaking changes from 0.x to 1.x

In 1.x, we use `prop-types` package instead of using it directly in React. Thus we dropped support under `react@15.5.0`. The usage will remain the same.
